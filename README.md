# Graph-analysis
Descriptive analysis of data on phages and rhizospheric microbiome associated with the control of Ralstonia solanacearum.

## Overview

This repository contains the scripts, datasets, and figures used for the descriptive analysis of phages and rhizosphere microbial communities associated with the biological control of Ralstonia solanacearum, a bacterial pathogen of major agricultural importance.

The main objective of this study is to explore the relationship between phages, rhizosphere bacteria, and the presence of the pathogen through statistical analyses, data visualization, and the identification of biological control patterns.

## Repository Structure

Codes/	Python scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Includes the scripts used to generate the figures presented in the study.
Figures/	Figures generated from the data analyses. Contains graphical representations such as distributions, treatment comparisons, and microbiome visualizations.
Files_CSV/	Data files in CSV format used as input for the analyses. Include abundance matrices, treatment data, and other variables for each sample.
READMES/	Additional README documents providing details for specific analyses or sections.

## Requirements

To run the scripts, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-plotly
-statsmodels


Install them with: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly statsmodels

## General Methodology

Data processing: cleaning and normalization of abundance matrices.
Descriptive analysis: calculation of means, deviations, and comparison among treatments.
Visualization: generation of representative figures (e.g., boxplots, bar charts, and scatter plots).
Interpretation: identification of patterns in the interaction between phages and R. solanacearum.
